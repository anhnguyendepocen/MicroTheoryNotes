Axioms of Rational Choice Completeness: For any \\(A \\text{ and } B\\) either a) \\(A \\succ B\\), b) \\(A \\prec B\\), or c) \\(A \\sim B\\) Not paralyzed by indecision. Transitivity If \\(A \\succ B\\) and \\(B \\succ C\\), then \\(A \\succ C\\) Continuity If \\(A \\succ B\\), then “close to \\(A\\)” \\(\\succ B\\) Technical detail that allows us to take derivatives. Utility - Ranking of Preferences If \\(A \\succ B\\) then \\(U(A) &gt; U(B)\\) Utility function assigns a number Not unique. Two utility functions can represent the same preferences This means utility functions only tell us order, not magnitude. \\(U_1, \\text{ &amp; } U_2\\) can represent the same preferences while \\(U_1(A)=1\\) and \\(U_2(A)=1,000\\) This is useful in emperical work because prefrences are preserved under a strictly monotonic transformation. \\(U_2(A) = ln(U)\\) - same preferences. {sketch ln(x)} “Goods” More is Better - Nonsatiation nbn "]
