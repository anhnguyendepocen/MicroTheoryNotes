Axioms of Rational Choice Completeness: For any \\(A \\text{ and } B\\) either a) \\(A \\succ B\\), b) \\(A \\prec B\\), or c) \\(A \\sim B\\) Not paralyzed by indecision. Transitivity If \\(A \\succ B\\) and \\(B \\succ C\\), then \\(A \\succ C\\) Continuity If \\(A \\succ B\\), then “close to \\(A\\)” \\(\\succ B\\) Technical detail that allows us to take derivatives. II. Utility - Ranking of Preferences If \\(A \\succ B\\) then \\(U(A) &gt; U(B)\\) Utility function assigns a number Not unique. Two utility functions can represent the same preferences This means utility functions only tell us order, not magnitude. \\(U_1, \\text{ &amp; } U_2\\) can represent the same preferences while \\(U_1(A)=1\\) and \\(U_2(A)=1,000\\) This is useful in empirical work because preferences are preserved under a strictly monotonic transformation. \\(U_2(A) = ln(U)\\) - same preferences. {sketch ln(x)} III. “Goods” More is Better - Non-satiation Figure 1. Non-satiation Actually, just from the transitive axiom of rational choice we can deduce one important thing about indifference curves. There can be no crossing indifference curves. See figure 2. \\(A \\succ B\\) and \\(B \\sim C \\Rightarrow A \\succ C\\) by the transitive axiom of rational prefrences. Also, it is clear from the figure that \\(C \\succ D\\) because it is more of both x and y. But also \\(D \\sim A\\) because they are on the same indifference curve. Using the transitive axiom again \\(\\Rightarrow C \\succ A\\) But this is a contradiction. So there can be no crossing indifference curves. Figure 2. No Crossing Indifference Curves IV. Indifference Curves and the MRS If utility is represented by the function \\(U=f(x,y)\\), then \\(10 = f(x,y)\\) represents an implicit function that define all the combinations of x and y that achieve the same level of utility (10). Called an indifference curve Figure 3. Preferred Set Figure 2 shows all the combinations of x and y that yield higher utility than \\(U=10\\). Slope of the indifference curve represents preferences over tradoffs between x and y. If you had to give up one unit of y how much additional x would it take to make you just as happy? Figure 4. Slope of the Indifference Curve You can imagine the two points in figure 3 getting closer and closer together, then the concept of slope of the indifference curve at a point becomes an important measure of a person’s willingness to trade one good for another at a given utility level. We define the concept of Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) as follows: \\[MRS = -\\frac{dy}{dx} \\Bigg\\rvert_{U=U_1}\\] V. Properties of a Utility Function Assuming diminishing MRS says something about hte curvature of the indifference curves. It turns out that for a candidate function to qualify as a valid utiliyt function, the indifference curves must be downward sloped, and in addition they must exhibit diminishing MRS. I.e., in figure 4 the tangent line at point A must be more steep than the tangent line at point B. Figure 5. Slope of the Indifference Curve This is equivalent to saying that indifference curves must be convex. \\[\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \\Bigg\\rvert_{U=U_1} &gt;0 \\] {Smileys for remembering the 2nd order conditions} This is the same as saying the preferred set is a convex set. Definition A set \\(X\\) is convex if and only if the linear combination of any two points in the set is also in the set. \\[x_1,x_2 \\in X \\Rightarrow ax_1 + bx_2 \\in X \\text{ for any non-negative constants } a \\text{ and } b\\] Figure 6. Convex Sets in Math In figure 5, the second graph shows a set that is not convex because we can find constants a and b such that \\(ay_1 + by_2 \\notin \\Psi\\) In an economic context, preferred sets are convext if and only if indifference curves exhibit diminishing MRS. Figure 7. Convex Preferred Set This implies a preference for balance rather than extremes. All these are quivalent to saying a candidate function is an appropriate utility function if and only if it is a quasi-concave function. VI. MRS and Marginal Utility Suppose utility is given by \\(U(x,y)\\). Now take the total differential of the utility function. \\[dU = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}dy\\] Now, \\(dU=0\\) represents an indifference curve. \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp; = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}dy \\\\ -\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}dx &amp; = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}dy \\\\ \\frac{\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}}{\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}} &amp; = -\\frac{dy}{dx} \\\\ \\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} &amp; = MRS \\end{align*}\\] So, we have found that the MRS is equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities. VII. Examples of Specific Utility Functions Figure 8. Specific Utility Examples Cobb-Douglass Utility. \\(U(x,y) = x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}\\) Perfect Substitutes. \\(U(x,y) = \\alpha x + \\beta y\\) Perfect Compliments. \\(U(x,y) = min(\\alpha x, \\beta y)\\) Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES). \\(U(x,y) = \\alpha \\frac{x^{\\delta}}{\\delta} + \\beta \\frac{y^{\\delta}}{\\delta} \\text{ for } \\delta \\neq 0\\) Notice that the first three are special cases of the CES utility function. \\(\\delta \\rightarrow 0\\) is Cobb-Douglas, \\(\\delta = 1\\) is perfect substitutes, and \\(\\delta \\rightarrow \\infty\\) is perfect compliments. All CES utility functions are examples of Homothetic Utility functions. Homothetic Utiliy A utility function is homothetic if and only if \\(U(ax,ay) = aU(x,y)\\) for any constant \\(a\\). This implies that along a ray through the origin, the MRS of all indifference curves will be the same, as shown in figure 9. Figure 9. Specific Utility Examples This property also implies that the MRS depends only on the ratio of the goods. $MRS(). To see an example, consider the Cobb-Douglass utility. \\[MRS = \\frac{\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}}{\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}} = \\frac{\\alpha x^{\\alpha - 1} y^{\\beta}}{\\beta x^{\\alpha} y^{\\beta - 1}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} \\frac{y}{x}\\] This concept is not to be confused with homothetic functions in math. In math, a homothetic function is a monotonic transformation of a homogenous function. A function is homogenous of degree k if \\(f(\\alpha x, \\alpha y) = \\alpha^k f(x,y)\\). "]
